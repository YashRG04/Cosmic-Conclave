    info: "Since the beginning of humankind, we have always looked forward to grasp those unknown treasures which have always eluded us. And yet we strive to reach for them with unbreakable determination and strength. The main driving force of a treasure hunt being the mystery that surrounds it, it is that doubt swirling within our thoughts whether we are going in the right direction or not, to attain our ultimate treasure which makes our hearts race and adrenaline pumping and hence we bring to you an event which would help you experience all of these things and learn something more about the universe that we live in. And the fact that goodies await for those to reach the ultimate treasure acts as an additional motivation which cannot be ignored.",
